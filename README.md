CoviMate / CoviTrack is a COVID-19 tracker app which displays the latest COVID-19 numbers, including Cases, Recoveries, and Vaccination Numbers, which are country specific and can be filtered out with the help of a dropdown menu. The numbers and counts are displayed with the help of graphs. Apart from COVID-19 statistics, it also has a news section displaying news articles regarding COVID-19 in India, from trusted news sources. There is also a section displaying state-wise medical colleges, hospitals and Oxygen Vendors. The app is built with React Native, and it fetches data from the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 API. Work to slightly redesign the app and include global and country specific news is being done.
